# django-example
sample Django project

## Project idea
probably some dictionary store.  
I send API req to lookup a word.  
LLM fetches the definition on whitelisted sources.  
Stores it in DB.  

### MVP
[] API to store words i've searched.  
[] API to list all words i've stored.  
[] API to update and tailor the list of definitions.  
[] API to delete the words (hard delete).  

### future 
[] interactive selection of definition.  
[] log sources on where i encountered the word.  
[] translations into other words.  
[] etymology.
